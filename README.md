## Description

**PIA-ae** (Physics-Informed Autoencoder) is a project aimed at estimating dense matter parameters in neutron stars through an explainable autoencoder framework. This approach integrates physical laws directly into the autoencoder's architecture, ensuring that the latent space is interpretable and aligned with observable astrophysical quantities. While raditional machine learning models often function as "black boxes", offering limited interpretability, PIA-ae addresses this by embedding physical constraints into the autoencoder. *The methodology used to build this network is generalizable to a wide range of physical problems*.
